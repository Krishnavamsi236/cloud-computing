## üìå Project Details

## üìñ Abstract

Amazon QuickSight is used to visualize data quickly and effectively. Starting from data preparation to building interactive dashboards, this project showcases:
- Uploading data to Amazon S3
- Connecting QuickSight to the S3 dataset
- Creating graphs like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts
- Enabling collaboration through shared dashboards
- Automating data refreshes for real-time updates

---

## üîß Tools & Technologies Used

- **Amazon S3** - Cloud storage service used to host the dataset
- **Amazon QuickSight** - Used to create dashboards and analyze data
- **Bright Data** - For acquiring large dataset (Amazon Bestseller Dataset)

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Resources Used

- `Amazon-Bestseller-Dataset.csv` (Uploaded to S3 bucket)
- JSON configuration for S3 dataset connection
- AWS Console

## üìà Procedure

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**
   - Example: `vamsi-project`
   - Upload `Amazon-Bestseller-Dataset.csv` to it

2. **Access BrightData**
   - Download large datasets from [Bright Data](https://brightdata.com)

3. **Prepare JSON Metadata**
   - JSON snippet to define dataset location and format:
     ```json
     {
       "fileLocations": [
         {
           "URIs": ["s3://vamsi-project/Amazon-Bestseller-Dataset.csv"]
         }
       ],
       "globalUploadSettings": {
         "format": "CSV",
         "delimiter": ",",
         "textqualifier": "\"",
         "containsHeader": "true"
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Set Up QuickSight**
   - Sign up via AWS Console
   - Connect QuickSight to the S3 bucket (enable auto-discovery)

5. **Create Dataset in QuickSight**
   - Use the JSON to connect to the S3 data
   - Name and save the dataset

6. **Visualize Data**
   - Drag and drop fields to create:
     - Bar charts
     - Pie charts
     - Line graphs
     - Sorted lists by brand, price, etc.
